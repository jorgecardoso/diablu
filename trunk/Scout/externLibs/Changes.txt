-----------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.99 - 16 November 2007

This release introduced a new name for this application (was
DiABlu Server). It also introduced a change in the project 
structure: Scout only deals with finding devices and info 
about them; it does not allow communication with the mobile 
version.

[ changes ]

+ Now determines major, minor device class and manufacturer 
  and sends this info over OSC

+ OSC messages changed to accomodate the extra info. This 
  may break some target applications...

- Does not support receiving messages from DiABlu Mobile 
  anymore.

- Does not allow setting the service name, since it doesn't 
  run any BT service anymore.

- Does not support the servicename command line parameter 
  anymore.
